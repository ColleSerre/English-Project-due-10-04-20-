Old friend dear friend some daywhen I have had my say and the world its way when all that is left is the gathering in of ends and forgathering of friends on some autumn evening when the mullet leapin a sea of silver-grey then  O then I will come stay for as long as I may stay till the time for sleep gaze at the rock that died before me the sea that lives for ever of air and sunlight  frost and wave and cloud and all the remembered agony and joyfashion my shroud Behind the eyelids the giant in the sky is probably sightless  but that can't be known Cruciform from full-stretched arms his black robe drops the whole way to the city His fingers point down at our rooftops We don't know about him He knows all about us By the fire the child's nightgown is warmed for bed It's a book entitled Under the Sunset by Brain Stoker MA my mother's copy in green cloth board has nearly lost the spine but a few threads hold her childhood and mine Tucked and kissed for the dark I shut my eyes too tight on a picture-book for waking to loosen Locked on to where people believe in themselves engraved fingers point down Freshened by any wind  sanitised with pine and cypress the slaughterhouse is cool as a church inside High rafters too A gallery The hooks hang readyNothing else intercepts the day's late blaze across the Seven Sleepers' chins and Cooper's Knobs  on this point between adjacent bays  only blotched light can get past  as the wind in the trees fidgeting to the doorway The door on its iron track having been wheeled back wide enough the small boys  me and Bob Crawford can see in One of the men turns our way  in the act of closing his left hand on the lamb's throat  at the bass viol the right  the bowing hand slashes deep in blood stepped in so far will up to the eyes or the ears be enough They're all busy now  the hosing down will have started Add water and sweep shit pellets puddled blood  the gulps  discharges over the rock-face misting all the way to the green bay water  with a noise of waters  where the round stain marked  An enrichment I think the children had been silent all this time I will have pulled my bike off his on the tree Nothing alters this Nobody comes up from the sea as late as this in the day and the season and nobody else goes down the last steep kilometre wet-metalled where a shower passed shredding the light which keeps pouring out of its tank in the sky through summits trees vapours thickening and thinning Too credibly by half celestial the dammed reservoir up there keeps emptying while the light lasts over the sea where ‘it gathers the gold against it’ The light is bits of crushed rock randomly glinting underfoot dampened by the short shower and down you go and so in its way does the sun which gets there first Boys two of them turn campfirelit faces a hesitancy to speak is a hesitancy of the earth rolling back and away behind this man going down to the sea with a bag to pick mussels having an arrangement with the tide the ocean to be shallowed three point seven meters one hour’s light to be left and there’s the excrescent moon sponging off the last of it A door slams a heavy wave a door the sea-floor shudders Down you go alone so late into the surge-black fissure Our beach was never so bare Freak tidesystem fault inhuman error will it never stop falling? After dark said the tables of high water and sunset pasted on the wall which don’t deceive Come on down for a walk while there’s light A wall of pale green glass miles above head high alongside complete with fish crossing is what will have been the wave once it has broken Leviathan is the beached cachalot we left Bob Falla
filleting for science the ebb to wash away these fifty years each one smaller than the last Come down this is today delivered factory fresh in colour heated by the late sun Time to try looking on the bright side or join those Great God (says the poem) who’d rather be suckled in a creed outworn: but whose cast-off cult’s to be the lucky one? Great waters unfinished business done blind to the deadline From that rock to this tree was tapu and it sticks Thin pickings Tangaroa this is pakeha story time only Okeanos and sister Tethys having it off the way they love makes hairy cliff-hanging seas roll drums on the sand the 3-metre swell flat on the seabed bangs the pubes very ancient and fishlike they smell close to Divine all the same  Dangerous not to be approached least of all by mortal man whose years are four-score plus tomorrow night While I count the three strong swimmers carried past out of sight round the North Rocks the whole shoreline shakes underfoot again dead friends call out not to be heard Look west what looks back is blood-orange nightfall the stooped sky drowning another sun overboard where the horizon was: till it snapped those deep-sea moorings and will be heard oncoming the sound of a scream tsunami tsunami splintering deadwood of the boat I lost half a life ago swept away with a judgment on the work she’s amateur built but your friends won’t know Last seen one inflatable rescue craft stood on its tuck bows to skyward in fast failing light a turning tide
